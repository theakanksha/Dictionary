# Dictionary App

## A ReactJS learning project.

### Idea-

This is a Dictionary created using ReactJs. It displays the meaning of the searched word on basis of the used dataset. It also has word prediction feature i.e it predicts the word in case it finds a related word considering the word entered has been mispelled by the user.

### Deployement- 

I have deployed this project using Netlify. The link is- https://dictionaryakanksha.netlify.com
